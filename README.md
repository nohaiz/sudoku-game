## **Overview:**
Sudoku is a fun logic puzzle played on a 9x9 grid. The goal is to fill the grid with numbers 1 through 9 so that each row, column, and 3x3 box contains every digit exactly once. It's loved for its simplicity and the mental workout it gives your brainâ€”you'll need to use logic and strategy to crack each puzzle. Originally popularized in Japan in the 1980s, Sudoku has become a worldwide favorite, known for its ability to entertain and challenge players of all ages.

## **Technologies used:**

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript

## **Getting started:**

A Trello board was used to keep track of development progress and can be viewed [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/AzK1sUgT/sudoku).

The project itself was deployed and can be viewed [Sudoku Project](https://nohaiz.github.io/sudoku-game/).

### 5. Losing Board
Achieving a score of 3/3 prompts the board to auto-fill the correct numbers. The game concludes, indicating it's over, with incorrect numbers highlighted in red.

Completing the board before getting 3 incorrect placements changes the number color to green, signifying victory. The game announces, "Game Over: You Win."

As the next step, I will include a note list where you can select numbers to place them in the grid as potential solutions for the Sudoku puzzle. This feature serves as a helpful reminder of the possible number placements available.
